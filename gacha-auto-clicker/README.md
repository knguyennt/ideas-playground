# Gacha Daily Automation

Tired of the daily grind in gacha games? This automation will do the work for you. Inspired by the game **Epic 7**, this tool is designed to handle your daily tasks, saving you time and effort.

## Initial Idea

- Utilize a library to capture pixels or images that require clicks or conditions to trigger a button press.
- Map out button click conditions to handle different tasks.
- Implement a cycle through various tasks, since daily activities in gacha games can be numerous.
